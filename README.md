# A Kinto and Ruby thing

Not really a client. Definitely not a gem.

Handy links:

* [Kinto](https://kinto.readthedocs.org)
* [How to run it with Docker](https://kinto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/get-started.html#using-docker)
* [The HTTP API](https://kinto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/1.x/index.html)
* [J-Dilla](http://www.npr.org/sections/ablogsupreme/2013/02/07/171349007/why-j-dilla-may-be-jazzs-latest-great-innovator) is a great producer you should know about, non-appropo to this

Someday: get this to work with Dockerfile and docker-compose
